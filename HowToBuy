heres a tutorial on how to buy from me because you are so dumbbgtfkdmjhubiredmkls
1. first you have to decide which item you wanna buy (aknowledge the price goofy) and make sure you got za cash!!!!!!!
2. you either comment on one of my github thingys (idk if you can even do that) or literally just approach me in person and ask me
3. give za cash first!!!!! i might need to take your computer for a bit if the downloads take a long time soooo (they dont usually take long)
4. you get what you asked for!!!!!!!! if it gets patched no refunds and im saying from now no refunds ill just try to find a fix and give for like 50-80% off

(also ms.edmunds or whatever school board administrator person is looking at this, please dont, all school does is waste our time and not even teach us how to make money. Im trying to make actual money because school doesnt teach you how (also ik its a bad way to make money lolololololollololol)
